# satellite

A toy implementation of the DPLL SAT algorithm written in Python.

This repo may hopefully be interesting to anyone trying to understand the DPLL
SAT algorithm by playing around with a very simple implementation.

The implementation was based on the description found in the following
Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm

No docs provided currently :).  If you're curious how things work, have a look
at the test suite.

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:davesque/satellite.git
cd satellite
make
```

## Running the tests

From the project root directory:
```
make test
```
