A toy implementation of the DPLL SAT algorithm written in Python.

This repo may hopefully be interesting to anyone trying to understand the DPLL
SAT algorithm by playing around with a very simple implementation.

The implementation was based on the description found in the following
Wikipedia article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:davesque/satellite.git
cd satellite
make
